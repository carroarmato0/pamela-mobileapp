Simple HTML5 + CSS + JS webpage for displaying the nodes in Pamela.

A simple alternative webpage for displaying the node in Pamela ( Pretty Amazing Member Enabled Localization Application, https://github.com/sandb/pamela )

Uses the HTML5 Boilerplate (https://html5boilerplate.com/), jQuery, a responsive theme and Modernizr.

this project, as is, relies on a modified version of pamela which adds a "@Location" to the end of node names.
The names are then sorted into location groups. This is done statically, so you will have to edit index.html and main.js to add or modify location groups.
